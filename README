fopen2019
-----

# PROBLEM
fopen occasionally fails on relatively recent Android such as Pixcel3, leaving errno = 13 (Permission Denied).

# ABOUT THIS
This is an example project to reproduce the problem.

This example is based on hello-jni project.
https://github.com/android/ndk-samples/tree/master/hello-jni

The core is fopen2019.c (https://github.com/inada-s/fopen2019/blob/master/hello-fopen/app/src/main/cpp/fopen2019.c)

It calls fopen many times while allocating memory with malloc.
